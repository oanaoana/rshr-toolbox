# Rank Structured Hessenberg Reduction

RSHR is a toolkit that implements fast Hessenberg
reduction for rank structured matrices. 

The toolkit provides MATLAB / Octave implementations, 
and fast FORTRAN implementations with MATLAB / Octave
wrappers as MEX files. These implementations can also
be used independently.
